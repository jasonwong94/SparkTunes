original files obtained from: onlinesequencer.net :) and are stored in the `/mp3` directory.

As the notes are in one .ogg file, you will need to extract parts of the audio using Audacity. I believe C6 starts at 0:56.

To extract sounds, go to "Chrome Dev Tools" and then to the "Network" tab. Aftewards search for .ogg file. Note: you would want to have Dev Tools open *before* the page loads (otherwise it won't record the data)
